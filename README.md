# **Financial Fraud & Money Laundering Detection System**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions and money laundering activities using **graph databases** and **data analytics**. By analyzing financial transactions between customers, merchants, accounts, and banks, we aim to uncover suspicious patterns that indicate illicit activities.  

The solution includes:  
- **ETL Pipeline:** Extract, Transform, and Load financial transaction data for analysis.  
- **Graph Database Modeling:** Efficiently store and query complex relationships between financial entities.  
- **Advanced Querying & Analytics:** Use graph-based queries and statistical methods for anomaly detection.  
- **Fraud & Money Laundering Detection:** Identify high-risk accounts, suspicious transaction patterns, and hidden networks of fraudulent behavior.

## **3. ETL Pipeline Implementation**  
Implemented using **Python & Pandas**, the pipeline performs:  
- **Data Extraction:** Load transaction data from CSV.  
- **Data Transformation:** Convert timestamps, normalize amounts, and map relationships.  
- **Data Loading:** Insert structured data into **Neo4j** for graph-based analysis.  


## **4. Conclusion**
This project showcases how **Graph Databases, Data Engineering, and Analytics** can be leveraged for **fraud detection in financial transactions**. By using a **graph-based approach**, we efficiently identify **suspicious transaction patterns, high-risk accounts, and fraudulent networks**, making it a **powerful industry-standard solution**.
